Welcome to **CW_TRAINER**, a Morse code training tool.

## 📥 How to Install and Run

1. **Download the ZIP file** of the latest release from the repository.
2. Locate the ZIP file on your computer and **extract (unzip)** it.
3. Open the extracted folder and navigate to the latest version (e.g., `V-1.8`).
4. Inside the `dist` folder, you’ll find two files:
   - `settings.json`
   - `V-1.8.exe` (the main executable)

   > ⚠️ If you don't see the `settings.json` file at first, it will be created automatically after you run the `.exe` file for the first time.

5. **Run the `.exe` file** by double-clicking it.
